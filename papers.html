            The Big Kahuna.
            This is my PhD dissertation, which summarizes the user-aware computing paradigms that I researched over the course of my program.

            Humans are incredibly diverse and complex.
            Unfortunately, personal computing devices are designed and optimized to best suit the average user, rather than considering the individual.
            Over-designing a computer system is wasteful from a power and expense standpoint.
            On the other hand, under-designed systems use less power and hardware, but can harm the overall user experience by not successfully meeting the user’s performance needs.
            This leaves a significant amount of room for optimization and improvement in the design of these systems; without a full understanding of the user impact of a design decision, any solution is likely to be suboptimal.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
            To address this, this work proposes the use of systems which have an improved contextual understanding of the individual user.
            This not only enables the creation of a more personalized system, but also allows the system to react to fluctuations in individual's requirements of the system over time.
            Additionally, this work explores the benefits to be gained by targeting performance metrics which are known to closely reflect actual user sentiment when designing and optimizing hardware and systems.

            Modern smartphones and tablets are battery-constrained by their mobility; this constraint is heavily factored into any design decision made on the device.
            Furthermore, the display is one of the most power-consuming subsystems.
            Adaptive display brightness systems attempt to address this high display power consumption by setting the brightness depending on the surrounding ambient light levels.
        </p>

        <p class="hidden">
            In this work, we run a series of user studies aimed at gauging the accuracy of these adaptive brightness models.
            These studies compare subjective satisfaction and readability metrics on a common smartphone display and find that the adaptive brightness system isn’t well-tuned to user prefer- ences.
            We also find that subjective ratings and readability are closely correlated with one another across different dis- play brightness levels, which can be used to give a better understanding of how screen brightness levels impact users.
        </p>

        <p class="hidden">
            Additionally, we note that operating systems need to reduce the power envelope of the device for a variety of reasons.
            This is done without understanding the impact of these decisions on user satisfaction, and can significantly degrade user experience.
            In this work, we propose a user-aware method of reducing display power consumption, which allows display power to be throttled while understanding the resulting im- pact on the user.
            By considering this impact on the user, we devise an optimal dimming scheme which can reduce the time-weighted readability degradation by upwards of 21.5%.

            This is an earlier academic paper for my research at Northwestern.
            This paper presents Dynamic Directories, which is a many-core (NUCA) optimization.
            NUCA means that each core doesn't share cache data via a bus; rather, each core shares the data using packets and directory lookups over an on-chip network.
            This paper presents a way of saving network power by reducing the number of network hops required to perform a directory lookup.
            More details are available in the paper.
